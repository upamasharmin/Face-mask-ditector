# Face mask ditector
 I have tried to build a face mask ditector using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN),Python,Keras,Tensorflow and OpenCv.Due to Covid-19 pandemic these type of system would be very supportive for many kind of institutions.With further improvements this  model  can be integrated  with CCTV or other types of cameras to detect  people without masks.I have used the dataset created by Prajna Bhandary and it is available at Github.
